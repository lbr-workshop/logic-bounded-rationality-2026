# Logic and Bounded Rationality 2026

**University of Milan · Online Workshop · 25–27 February 2026 · Microsoft Teams**

The workshop *Logic and Bounded Rationality 2026* brings together researchers working on logical, philosophical, and computational approaches to reasoning under resource constraints.

## Organizers
- Costanza Larese (University of Milan)
- Marcello D'Agostino (University of Milan)

## Aims and Scope

The “cost of reasoning”, i.e., the cognitive or computational effort required by non-ideal, resource-bounded (human or artificial) agents in order to perform non-trivial inferences, is a crucial issue in philosophy, AI, economics and cognitive (neuro)science. Accounting for this fundamental variable in modelling real world reasoning and decision-making is one of the most important and difficult challenges in the theory of rationality. With this workshop, we are launching a <a href="https://www.collegepublications.co.uk/logic/lbr/" target="_blank"> book series </a> for College Publications that, under the general title of “Logic and Bounded Rationality”, aims to create a community of researchers from several areas that wish to cooperate towards a systematic logical view of bounded rationality.

## Format
Invited talks and thematic discussions. **No call for papers.**

## Participation
Open to all. No Microsoft account required.
