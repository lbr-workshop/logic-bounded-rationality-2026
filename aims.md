The “cost of reasoning”, i.e., the cognitive or computational effort required by non-ideal, resource-bounded (human or artificial) agents in order to perform non-trivial inferences, is a crucial issue in philosophy, AI, economics and cognitive (neuro)science. Accounting for this fundamental variable in modelling real world reasoning and decision-making is one of the most important and difficult challenges in the theory of rationality. With this workshop, we are launching a book series for College Publications that, under the general title of “Logic and Bounded Rationality”, aims to create a community of researchers from several areas that wish to cooperate towards a systematic logical view of bounded rationality.
